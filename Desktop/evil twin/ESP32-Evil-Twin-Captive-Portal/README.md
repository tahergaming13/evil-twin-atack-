A standalone WiFi Penetration Testing tool for ESP32. This project creates an "Evil Twin" Access Point that mimics legitimate networks to capture credentials via a realistic Captive Portal.

## ⚡ Features

* **Network Scanning:** Scans for available WiFi networks (AP + STA mode).
* **Evil Twin Attack:** Clones SSID and creates an open Access Point.
* **DNS Hijacking:** Redirects all traffic (Google, Apple, Android captive checks) to the phishing page.
* **Credential Harvesting:** Logs usernames/passwords to internal SPIFFS storage.
* **Mobile-Friendly Admin UI:** Control the device from your phone.
* **Global Channel Support:** Unlocked channels 1-13 (CN/JP region fix).
* **Custom HTML Support:** Upload your own phishing pages via the Admin Interface.
* **Persistent Configuration:** Settings saved in memory.

## 🛠️ Hardware Required

* **ESP32 Development Board** (ESP32-WROOM-32 or similar).
* USB Cable for power/programming.

## 💾 Installation

1.  **Install Arduino IDE:** Ensure you have the [ESP32 Board Manager](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json) installed.
2.  **Libraries:** This sketch uses built-in ESP32 libraries:
    * `WiFi.h`
    * `WebServer.h`
    * `DNSServer.h`
    * `SPIFFS.h`
3.  **Partition Scheme:**
    * In Arduino IDE, go to **Tools > Partition Scheme**.
    * Select **"Default 4MB with SPIFFS"** (or any scheme that includes SPIFFS).
4.  **Upload:** Connect your ESP32 and upload the `Evil_Portal.ino`.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Connect to Admin Panel
1. Power on the ESP32.
2. Connect your phone/PC to the WiFi network: `WiFi_Pentest`.
3. Password: `password123`.
4. Open a browser and navigate to: `http://192.168.4.1/admin`.

### 2. Launch an Attack
1. Go to the **Scan** tab to find targets.
2. Click **Select** on the target network.
3. Click **START** in the control panel.
4. The ESP32 will now broadcast the target SSID.

### 3. View Logs
1. When a victim connects and enters a password, it is saved.
2. Refresh the **Admin Panel** to view captured credentials in the "Captured Data" section.
3. Logs are persistent (saved to flash memory) until you click **Clear**.
